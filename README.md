# Spatial Transcriptomics Data Analysis Tutorial

**Spatial Transcriptomics Data Analysis Tutorial** provides a step-by-step guide to analyzing publicly available spatial transcriptomics datasets. This tutorial uses **Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resection specimens** (Zhang et. al. 2023).  The detailed workflow is in **`ST_Complete_Tutorial_AKS.ipynb`** (main folder), while seperate focused analyses are available in the notebooks/ folder: 
- `Sample_HCC1R.ipynb`: Sample-specific quality filtering (HCC1R)
- `Exercise_Normalization_AKS.ipynb` Normalization deep dive
- `Exercise_Clustering_AKS.ipynb` Clustering analysis
- `Exercise_CellTypeAnnotation_AKS.ipynb` Cell type annotation
Also; additional scripts if required are placed in the

## Overview
This tutorial covers the following steps in spatial transcriptomics analysis:
1. **Dataset Selection and Download**
2. **Data Loading and Creation of `SingleCell` Object**
3. **Normalization, PCA, UMAP, Clustering, and Visualization**
4. **Marker Gene Identification**
5. **Cell Type Annotation using `CellTypist`**

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the dataset from **Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resection specimens**. The dataset was downloaded from the **GEO database** under the accession number **GSE238264_RAW**.
- **Dataset Link**: [GSE238264_RAW](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE238264)
- **Raw Data**: Stored in the `GSE238264_RAW` folder.
- **Outputs**: Stored in the `data` folder.

## Steps in the Tutorial
### 1. Select and Download Dataset
- Download the raw spatial transcriptomics data from **GEO** using the accession number **GSE238264**.
- Extract and place the data in the `GSE238264_RAW` folder.

### 2. Load Data and Create `SingleCell` Object
- Load the downloaded raw data into the analysis environment using **`scanpy`**.
- Create a `SingleCell` object for subsequent analysis.

### 3. Normalization, PCA, UMAP, Clustering, and Visualization
- Normalize the raw data using the log transformation (`log1p`).
- Perform **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction.
- Use **UMAP** (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for visualizing the data in 2D space.
- Perform clustering to identify distinct cell populations and visualize them on the UMAP plot.

### 4. Marker Gene Identification
- Identify marker genes that are differentially expressed across clusters or specific sample categories.
- Visualize the expression of these marker genes to understand the differences between clusters.

### 5. Cell Type Annotation
- Use **CellTypist** for cell type annotation.
- Optionally validate the annotations manually or using clustering methods.
- Explore other annotation tools like **SingleR** (R) or **Azimuth** for cross-validation.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA and UMAP for visualization.
- **Clustering**: Identify clusters of cells based on gene expression.
- **Marker Gene Identification**: Differential gene expression to identify cluster-specific markers.
- **Cell Type Annotation**: Use tools like `CellTypist` for automated cell type annotation.
